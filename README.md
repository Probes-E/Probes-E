- Merhaba, I am a map creator for Source and GoldScr. Haven't published many maps, little is left to learn.
- Trying out different languages and engines to suit me best, currently learning Blitz3D (Very new, I know.)
- If i encounter problems or need help I'll TRY to use github for its purpose. (Get it? TRY? The currency of Turkey? Aaah didn't make sense anyways...)
- Trying to find other people crazy enough to help this clutter of game development.
- Interested in GETTING SOME BIT-
